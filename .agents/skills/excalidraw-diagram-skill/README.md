# Excalidraw Diagram Skill

A coding agent skill that generates beautiful and practical Excalidraw diagrams from natural language descriptions. Not just boxes-and-arrows - diagrams that **argue visually**.

Compatible with any coding agent that supports skills. For agents that read from `.claude/skills/` (like [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) and [OpenCode](https://github.com/nicepkg/OpenCode)), just drop it in and go.

## What Makes This Different

- **Diagrams that argue, not display.** Every shape/group of shapes mirrors the concept it represents — fan-outs for one-to-many, timelines for sequences, convergence for aggregation. No uniform card grids.
- **Evidence artifacts.** Technical diagrams include real code snippets and actual JSON payloads.
- **Brand-customizable.** All colors and brand styles live in a single file (`references/color-palette.md`). Swap it out and every diagram follows your palette.
- **Direct local viewing.** Pure `.excalidraw` JSON generation designed for direct preview and editing in local Excalidraw UI extensions and editors.

## Usage

Ask your coding agent to create a diagram:

> "Create an Excalidraw diagram showing how the AG-UI protocol streams events from an AI agent to a frontend UI"

The skill handles concept mapping, visual hierarchy, layout geometry, and `.excalidraw` JSON generation.

## Customize Colors

Edit `references/color-palette.md` to match your brand. Everything else in the skill is universal design methodology.
